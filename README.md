Movie Filter App
This project is a Movie Filter Application built with React.js. It displays a collection of movies that can be filtered by categories such as Action, Thriller, Animation, Horror, Drama, and Sci-Fi. Users can browse the movie collection and navigate to external links to play selected movies.

Features:-
      Filter Movies by Categories: You can filter movies based on specific genres like Action, Thriller, Animation, Horror, Drama, and Sci-Fi.
      Dynamic Movie List: The movie list updates dynamically as the filter buttons are clicked, displaying only the relevant movies.
      Hover Animation on Posters: Movie posters have a smooth hover animation that zooms in on the image, adding an interactive feel.
      External Links to Movies: Each movie includes a "Play" button linking to external sources where the movie can be streamed.
      
Dependencies:-
      React.js: The app is built using React for UI components.
      React Router DOM: Used for handling routing within the app.
      
How to Use:-
      Open the application in your browser.
      Click any of the category buttons (e.g., Action, Thriller, Animation) to filter movies by genre.
      Hover over a movie poster to view the zoom-in effect.
      Click the "Play" button on any movie to be redirected to the movie's external streaming link.
      
Future Enhancements:-
      Add More Categories: Expand the filter options to include more genres.
      Pagination: Add pagination to handle a larger number of movies.
      Search Functionality: Implement a search bar for finding movies by title.
